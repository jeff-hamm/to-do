# Bowiephone Todo System - Audio File Upload Implementation

## ðŸŽµ **Feature Overview**

The Bowiephone Todo System now supports audio file uploads with automatic Google Drive integration! Users can attach audio files to their tasks, which are automatically uploaded to a shared Google Drive folder and linked in the task.

## ðŸš€ **Implementation Complete**

### âœ… **Client-Side Features**
- **Audio Field Type**: New 'audio' field in configuration system
- **File Upload**: Direct file selection with progress feedback
- **URL Input**: Manual Google Drive link input option
- **Upload Progress**: Loading states with custom messages
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messaging and validation
- **File Validation**: Audio file type and size (10MB) checking
- **Visual Feedback**: File selection indicators and upload status

### âœ… **Server-Side Features**
- **Google Apps Script**: Complete server implementation for file handling
- **Google Drive Integration**: Automatic file upload to shared folders
- **Shareable Links**: Automatic public link generation
- **File Management**: Timestamp-based naming to prevent conflicts
- **Security**: Server-side processing keeps API credentials secure

## ðŸ›  **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Deploy the Google Apps Script**

1. Open the `GoogleAppsScript_FileUpload.gs` file in this directory
2. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) and create a new project
3. Replace the default code with the contents of the `.gs` file
4. Update the configuration constants:
   ```javascript
   const SPREADSHEET_ID = 'your-spreadsheet-id';
   const SHEET_NAME = 'your-sheet-name';
   const DRIVE_FOLDER_ID = 'your-shared-folder-id';
   ```
5. Enable the Google Drive API:
   - Click "Services" (+ icon) in left sidebar
   - Search for "Drive API" and add it
6. Deploy as web app:
   - Click "Deploy" > "New deployment"
   - Type: Web app
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone (required for CORS)
7. Copy the web app URL

### 2. **Update Client Configuration**

Update your `config.js` file with the new Apps Script URL:

```javascript
googleSheets: {
    enabled: true,
    spreadsheetId: 'your-spreadsheet-id',
    gid: 'your-gid',
    appScriptUrl: 'your-new-apps-script-url' // Update this with the URL from step 1
}
```

### 3. **Test the Implementation**

1. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:8000
3. Click "Add New Task"
4. Try both upload methods:
   - **File Upload**: Select an audio file using the file input
   - **URL Input**: Paste a Google Drive link directly

## ðŸ“‹ **How It Works**

### **User Experience Flow**
1. User clicks "Add New Task"
2. User can either:
   - Upload an audio file (automatic Google Drive upload)
   - Paste a Google Drive URL directly
3. If uploading a file:
   - File is validated (type and size)
   - Upload progress is shown
   - File is uploaded to shared Google Drive folder
   - Shareable link is automatically generated
4. Task is created with the audio link
5. Audio appears as clickable "ðŸŽµ Audio File" link in tasks

### **Technical Flow**
1. **Client**: User selects file in form
2. **Client**: Form submission triggers `handleAddTask()`
3. **Client**: File converted to base64 and sent to Apps Script
4. **Server**: Apps Script receives file data
5. **Server**: File uploaded to Google Drive folder
6. **Server**: File sharing permissions set to public
7. **Server**: Shareable URL returned to client
8. **Client**: Task created with audio URL
9. **Client**: Task rendered with clickable audio link

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX Features**

### **Form Interface**
- File input for direct upload
- URL input for manual links
- Google Drive folder link for reference
- File selection feedback
- Upload progress indicators

### **Task Display**
- Clickable audio links: "ðŸŽµ Audio File"
- Hover effects and styling
- Opens in new tab/window
- Consistent with overall theme

### **Loading States**
- "Uploading audio file to Google Drive..." during upload
- "Creating task..." during task creation
- Spinner with progress text
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## ðŸ”§ **Configuration Options**

### **Audio Field Configuration**
```javascript
audioFile: {
    type: 'audio',
    location: "detail",
    icon: 'ðŸŽµ',
    defaultValue: 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/...',
    options: {
        driveFolder: 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/...',
        accept: 'audio/*'
    }
}
```

### **File Upload Limits**
- **File Size**: 10MB maximum (Google Apps Script limit)
- **File Types**: Audio files only (`audio/*`)
- **Naming**: Automatic timestamp prefixing prevents conflicts

## ðŸ›¡ **Security & Privacy**

- **Server-Side Processing**: API credentials never exposed to client
- **File Validation**: Type and size checking prevents abuse
- **Public Sharing**: Files are set to "Anyone with link can view"
- **Shared Folder**: All uploads go to designated shared folder
- **No Authentication**: Uses service account for secure access

## ðŸš¨ **Error Handling**

### **Client-Side Validation**
- File type checking (audio files only)
- File size validation (10MB limit)
- Network error handling
- Upload timeout protection

### **Server-Side Validation**
- Base64 decoding validation
- Google Drive API error handling
- Folder access verification
- File creation error recovery

## ðŸ“± **Mobile Support**

- Responsive file upload interface
- Touch-friendly file selection
- Mobile-optimized progress indicators
- Works on all modern mobile browsers

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy Apps Script**: Follow setup instructions above
2. **Update Configuration**: Add new Apps Script URL to config
3. **Test Upload**: Try both file upload and URL input methods
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check Google Drive folder for uploads
5. **Optimize**: Adjust file size limits or add more file types as needed

The audio file upload feature is now fully implemented and ready for use! ðŸŽ‰
